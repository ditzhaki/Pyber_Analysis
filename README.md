# Pyber_Analysis

Performing analysis on PyBer data for Module 5 challenge.

## Overview

PyBer, a python based ride-sharing app, has tasked us with analyzing all of the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create compelling visualizations for the CEO, V. Isualize. The visualizations produced will showcase the relationship between the type of city (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and the number of drivers & riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis will also include a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a graph that showcases the total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis and visualizations will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine the affordability for underserved neighborhood. 

To perform this exploratory analysis, we will be using Pandas libraries, matplotlib, and jupyter notebook. 

## Results

Two CSV files were analyzed and merged into a single DataFrame which contained the following information:
* City in which the ride took place
* Date & time of the ride
* Fare of the ride
* Ride ID number
* The number of Drivers in that city
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural)

_Describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types using images from the summary dataframe and multiple-line chart_
